#  Employee Attrition Prediction

This project presents an interactive Streamlit web application for analyzing and predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The app is designed to help HR professionals understand attrition patterns and proactively identify employees at risk of leaving the organization.

The application has two main components:

#Dashboard (EDA View):
Provides visual insights into the dataset, including attrition distribution, departmental analysis, and a correlation heatmap of features.

# Attrition Prediction Tool:
Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical employee data to predict whether a new or existing employee is likely to leave. Users can input employee-specific data such as age, salary, department, overtime status, and more to get real-time predictions with probability scores.

# Key Features:
- Label encoding for categorical features  
- Interactive form-based user input  
- Model accuracy display  
- Real-time prediction with explanation  

This solution combines data visualization, preprocessing, machine learning, and real-time interactivity, making it a valuable tool for HR analytics and employee retention strategies.
